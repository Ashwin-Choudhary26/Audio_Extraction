# Audio_Extraction
This project works as an speech to text transcriptor, keyword extractor and recommendation system. 
It makes use of a pre-trained model to transcribe text from an audio. 
Keyword extraction is done by YAKE! and web scraping and link extraction is done by googlesearch usingÂ BeautifulSoup.
The Audio MP3 files given as input for the text extraction in txt files above could not be uploaded on the git. When running the model those audio files are supposed to be given as input from the local system directory.
