THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH DATA A LOT OF DATA PICTURES MUSIC WORDS SPREAD SHEETS VIDIOS AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ITS GOING TO SLOW DOWN ANY TIME SOON MACHINE LEARNING BRINGS THE PROMISE OF DERIVING MEANING FROM ALL THAT DATA ARTHUR C CLERK FAMOUSLY ONCE SAID ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED ECHNOLOGY IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MAGIC I'VE FOUND MACHINE LEARNING NOT TO BE MAGIC BUT RATHER TOOLS IN TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU CAN UTILIZE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WITH YOUR DATA THIS IS CLOUD A I ADVENTURES MY NAME IS UFANGUE AND EACH EPISODE WE WILL BE EXPLORING THE ART SCIENCE AND TOOLS OF MACHINE LEARNING ALONG THE WAY WE'LL SEE JUST HOW EASY IT IS TO CREATE AMAZING EXPERIENCES AND YIELD VALUABLE INSIGHTS THE VALUE OF MACHINE LEARNING IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW ITSELF THEREIS A LOT OF DATE IN THE WORLD TO DAY GENERATED NOT ONLY BY PEOPLE BUT ALSO BY COMPUTERS PHONES AND OTHER DEVICES THIS WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO GROWIN THE YEARS TO COME TRADITIONALLY HUMANS HAVE ANALYZED DATA AND ADAPTED SYSTEMS TO THE CHANGES IN DATA PATTERNS HOWEVER AS THE VOLUME OF DATA SURPASSES THE ABILITY FOR HUMANS TO MAKE SENSE OF IT AND MANUALLY RITE THOSE RULES WE WILL TURN INCREASINGLY TO AUTUMATED SYSTEMS THAT CAN LEARN FROM THE DATA AND IMPORTANTLY THE CHANGES IN DATA TO ADAPT TO A SHIFTING LANDSCAPE WE SEE MACHINE LEARNING ALL AROUND US IN THE PRODUCTS WE USE TO DAY HOWEVER IT ISN'T ALWAYS APPARENT THAT MACHINE LEARNING ISBEHIND IT ALL WHILE THINGS LIKE TAGGING OBJECTS AND PEOPLE INSIDE OF PHOTOS ARE CLEARLY MACHINE LEARNING AT PLAY IT MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT THAT RECOMMENDING THE NEXIVIDIO TO WATCH IS ALSO POWERED BY MACHINE LEARNING OF COURSE PERHAPS THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE OF ALL IS GUGAL SEARCH EVERY TIME YOU USE GUGL SEARCH YOU RE USING THE SYSTEM THAT HAS MANY MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS AT ITS CORE FROM UNDERSTANDING THE TEXTS OF YOUR QUERY TO ADJUSTING THE RESULTS BASED ON YOUR PERSONAL INTERESTS SUCHAS KNOWING WHICH RESULTS TO SHOW YOU FIRST WHEN SEARCHING FOR JABA DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU ARE COFFEE EXPERT OR DEVELOPER PERHAPS YOURE BOTH TO DAY MACHINE LEARNINGS IMMEDIATE APPLICATIONS ARE ALREADY QUITE WIDE RANGING INCLUDING IMMAGE RECOGNITION FRAUD DETECTION AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS AS WELL AS TACT AND SPEECH SYSTEMS TOO THESE POWERFUL CAPABILITIES CAN BE APPLIED TO A WIDE RANGE OF FIELDS FROM DIABETIC ETINOPATHY AND SKINCANC OR DETECTION TO RETAIL AND OF COURSE TRANSPORTATION IN THE FORM OF SEOF PARKING AND SELF DRIVING VEHICLES IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT WHEN A COMPANY OR PRODUCT HAD MACHINE LEARNING IN ITS OFFERINGS IT WAS CONSIDERED NOVEL NOW EVERY COMPANY IS PIVOTING TO USE MACHINE LEARNING IN THEIR PRODUCTS IN SOME WAY IT'S RAPIDLY BECOMING WELL AN EXPECTED FUTURE JUST AS WE EXPECT COMPANIES TO HAVE A WEBSIGHT THAT WORKS ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE OR PERHAPS AN AP THE DAY WILL SOON COME WHEN IT WILL BE EXPECTED THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL BE PERSONALIZED IN SIGHTFUL AND SELF CORRECTING AS WE USE MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE HUMAN TASKS BETTER FASTER AND EASIER THAN BEFORE WE CAN ALSO LOOK FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE WHEN MACHINE LEARNING CAN HELP US DUE TASKS THAT WE NEVER COULD HAVE ACHIEVED ON OUR OWN THANKFULLY IT'S NOT HARD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MACHINE LEANING TO DAY THE TOOLING HAS GOTTE QUITE GOOD ALL YOU NEED IS DATA DEVELOPERS AND A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THE PLUNGE FOR OUR PURPOSES I HAVE SHORTENED THE DEFINITION OF MACHINE LEARNING DOWN TO JUST FIVE WORDS USEING DATA TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHELL I WOULDN'T USE SUCH A SHORT ANSWER FOR AN ESSAY PROMPT ON EXAMINE IT SERVES A USEFUL PURPOSE FOR US HERE IN PARTICULAR WE CAN SPLIT THA DEFINITION INTO TWO PARTS USING DATA AND ANSWER QUESTIONS THESE TWO PIECES BROADLY OUTLINE THE TWO SIZE OF MACHINE LEARNING BOTH OF THEM EQUALLY IMPORTANT USING DATA IS WHAT WE REFERR TO AS TRAINING WELL ANSWER ING QUESTIONS IS REFERRED TO AS MAKING PREDICTIONS OR INFERENCS NOW LET'S DRL INTO THOSE TWO SIDES BRIEFLY FOR A LITTLE BIT TRAINING REFERS TO USING OUR DATA TO INFORM THE CREATION AND FINETOONING OF A PREDICTIVE MODEL THIS PREDICTIVE MODEL CAN THEN BE USED TO SERVE UP PREDICTIONS ON PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN DATA IN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AS MOREDATA HAS GATHERED THE MODEL CAN BE IMPROVED OVERTIME AND NEW PREDICTIVE MODELS DEPLOYED AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THE KEY COMPONER OF THIS ENTIRE PROCESS IS DATA EVERYTHING HINGES ON DATADATA IS THE KEY TO UNLOCKING MACHINE LEARNING JUST AS MUCH AS MACHINE LEARNING IS THE KEY TO UNLOCKING THAT HIDDEN INSIGHT IN DATA THIS WAS JUST A HIGH LEVEL OVER VIEW OF MACHINE LEARNING WHY IT'S USEFUL AND SOME OF ITS APPLICATIONS MACHINE LEARNING IS A BROADFIELD SPANNING AN ENTIRE FAMILY OF TECHNIQUES FOR INFERRING ANSWERS FROM DATA SO IN FUTURE EPISODES WILLIAM TO GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT APPROACHES TO USE FOR A GIVEN DATA SET AND QUESTION YOU WANT TO ANSWER AS WELL AS PROVIDE THE TOOLS FOR HOW TO ACCOMPLISH ITAND IN OUR NEXT EPISODE WE'LL DIVE RIGHT IN TO THE CONCRETE PROCESS OF DOING MACHINE LEARNING IN MORE DETAIL GOING THROUGH A STEP BY STEP FORMULA FOR HOW TO APPROACH MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS
